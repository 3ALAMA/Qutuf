# Arabic Morphological Analyzer and Part-Of-Speech Tagger

Qutuf (قُطُوْف): An Arabic Morphological analyzer and Part-Of-Speech tagger as an Expert System.

Qutuf is aimed to be the Core of a Framework for Arabic NLP (Natural Language Processing)

At Qutuf, some new concepts has been identified and implemented. Like First Normalization and Second Normalization text forms at the preprocessing phase and the Premature and Overdue Tagging at the Part-Of-Speech tagging task. Moreover, the POS tagging is designed and implemented as a rule-based expert system. A POS tagset, which is built based on a morphological feature tagset, has been designed and used in Qutuf.

The morphological analysis component at Qutuf uses finite state automates and rules for agreement developed for cliticalization parsing. It also uses AlKhalil Morpho Sys open source database for root extraction, pattern matching, morphological feature and POS assignment and closed nouns after enriching it.
